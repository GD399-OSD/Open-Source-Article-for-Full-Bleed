# Open-Source-Design-Article-for-Full-Bleed
Let's write an article on open source design together!

You can contribute on this [etherpad doc!](https://gd399-ether.herokuapp.com/p/Open_Source_Design_Article)

Here's the [second draft](https://gd399-ether.herokuapp.com/p/open-source-design-draft2).

And Here's the [third draft](https://gd399-ether.herokuapp.com/p/Open_Source_Design_Article_Draft_3).

The [fourth draft](https://gd399-ether.herokuapp.com/p/Open_Source_Design_Article_Draft_4)!

[Final draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xMKD0UcZj5hGi4h6jldzCj0ZPjLfZ08-C6cHaaHCgSc/edit?usp=sharing) <--- sorry this is a google drive link :( heroku was down. 

Now I'm looking for help with illustrations! Please download the SVG files I've added to the repository. Modify them, iterate, expand! I'd like to compile people's interpretations into one illustration that embodies the historied and networked qualities of Open Source.
