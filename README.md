# Open-Source-Design-Article-for-Full-Bleed
Let's write an article on open source design together!

You can contribute on this[etherpad doc!](https://gd399-ether.herokuapp.com/p/Open_Source_Design_Article)

I've been commissioned to write a piece about a design topic. This seems like a perfect opportunity to spotlight open source design. Specifically, I'm interested in exploring how open source intersects with issues of modernism, social design and technology. Furthermore I'm hoping that this article can describe the open source process and how this may be used to confront some of the big issues facing the world.

Please help create this article with me, by sharing thoughts, ideas, sentences, paragraphs, etc. Not only will this piece serve to spotlight open source design, it will be an example of it. 

There are some constraints to keep in mind. I'd like to have an initial draft by Thursday, February 22nd. Aditionaly, what ends up in the magazine should not exceed 2000 words.
