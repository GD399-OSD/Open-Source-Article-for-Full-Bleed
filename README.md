# Open-Source-Design-Article-for-Full-Bleed
Let's write an article on open source design together!

You can contribute on this [etherpad doc!](https://gd399-ether.herokuapp.com/p/Open_Source_Design_Article)

Here's the [second draft](https://gd399-ether.herokuapp.com/p/open-source-design-draft2).

I'm refining the intent based on Chris's edits, seeking to focus on Open Source Design as an "alternative approach to making/collaborating." To do this, I want to place Open Source design within a history starting with the arts and crafts movement.
